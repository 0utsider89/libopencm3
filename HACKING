Coding style
------------

The whole library is programmed using the Linux kernel coding style, see
http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for details.

Please use the same style for any code contributions, thanks!


Development guidelines
----------------------

 - Every new file added must have the usual license header, see the
   existing files for examples.

 - In general, please try to keep the register and bit naming as close
   as possible to the official ST datasheets. Among other reasons, this
   makes it easier for users to find what they're looking for in the
   datasheets, programming manuals, and application notes.

 - All register definitions should follow the following naming conventions:

   - The #define names should be all-caps, parts are separated by
     an underscore.

   - The name should be of the form SUBSYSTEM_REGISTER_BIT, e.g.
     ADC_CR2_DMA, where ADC is the subsystem name, CR2 is the register NAME,
     and DMA is the name of the bit in the register that is defined.

 - All subsystem-specific function names should be prefixed with the
   subsystem name. For example, gpio_set_mode() or rcc_osc_on().

 - Please consistently use the short form types from <cm3/common.h>,
   e.g. u8, u16, u32, and so on.

 - Variables that are used to store register values read from registers or
   to be stored in a register should be named reg8, reg16, reg32 etc.
