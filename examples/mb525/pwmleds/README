This is a PWM based led fading example using libopenstm32.

It's intended for the ST STM32-based MB525 eval board (see
http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/um/13472.htm for details). It
should blink the LED on the board.


Building
--------

 $ make

Running 'make' on the top-level libopenstm32 directory will automatically
also build this example. Or you can build the library "manually" and
then run 'make' in this directory.

You may want to override the toolchain (e.g., arm-elf or arm-none-eabi):

 $ PREFIX=arm-none-eabi make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1


Flashing
--------

You can flash the generated code on the MB525 board using OpenOCD:

 $ make flash

Or you can do the same manually via:

 $ openocd -f interface/jlink.cfg -f board/olimex_stm32_h103.cfg
 $ telnet localhost 4444
 > reset halt
 > flash write_image erase pwmleds.bin
 > reset

Replace the "jlink.cfg" with whatever JTAG device you are using, and/or
replace "olimex_stm32_h103.cfg" with your respective board config file.
