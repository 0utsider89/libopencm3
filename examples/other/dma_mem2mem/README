This program demonstrates a little DMA MEM2MEM transfer. A string is send out 
to USART1 and afterwards copied by DMA to another memory location. To check
if the transfer was successful we send the destination string also out to 
USART1.

The terminal settings for the receiving device/PC are 115200 8n1.


Building
--------

 $ make

Running 'make' on the top-level libopenstm32 directory will automatically
also build this example. Or you can build the library "manually" and
then run 'make' in this directory.

You may want to override the toolchain (e.g., arm-elf or arm-none-eabi):

 $ PREFIX=arm-none-eabi make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1


Flashing
--------

You can flash the generated code using OpenOCD:

 $ make flash

Or you can do the same manually via:

 $ openocd -f interface/jtagkey-tiny.cfg -f target/stm32.cfg
 $ telnet localhost 4444
 > reset halt
 > flash write_image erase dma.hex
 > reset

Replace the "jtagkey-tiny.cfg" with whatever JTAG device you are using, and/or
replace "stm.cfg" with your respective config file.
