This example program sends some characters on USART3 on the ST STM32-based
Olimex STM32-H103 eval board (see http://olimex.com/dev/stm32-h103.html
for details).

The terminal settings for the receiving device/PC are 38400 8n1.


Building
--------

 $ make

Running 'make' on the top-level libopenstm32 directory will automatically
also build this example. Or you can build the library "manually" and
then run 'make' in this directory.

You may want to override the toolchain (e.g., arm-elf or arm-none-eabi):

 $ PREFIX=arm-none-eabi make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1


Flashing
--------

You can flash the generated code on the STM32-H103 board using OpenOCD:

 $ make flash

Or you can do the same manually via:

 $ openocd -f interface/jtagkey-tiny.cfg -f board/olimex_stm32_h103.cfg
 $ telnet localhost 4444
 > reset halt
 > flash write_image erase usart.hex
 > reset

Replace the "jtagkey-tiny.cfg" with whatever JTAG device you are using, and/or
replace "olimex_stm32_h103.cfg" with your respective board config file.
