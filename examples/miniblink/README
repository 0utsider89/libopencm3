This is the smallest-possible example program using libopenstm32.

It's intended for the ST STM32-based Olimex STM32-H103 eval board (see
http://olimex.com/dev/stm32-h103.html for details). It should blink
the LED on the board.


Building
--------

 $ make

Running 'make' on the top-level libopenstm32 directory will automatically
also build this example. Or you can build the library "manually" and
then run 'make' in this directory.

You may want to override the toolchain (e.g., arm-elf or arm-none-eabi):

 $ PREFIX=arm-none-eabi make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1


Flashing
--------

You can flash the generated code on the STM32-H103 board using OpenOCD:

 $ make flash

Or you can do the same manually via:

 $ openocd -f interface/jtagkey-tiny.cfg -f board/olimex_stm32_h103.cfg
 $ telnet localhost 4444
 > init
 > reset halt
 > flash write_image erase miniblink.bin 0x08000000
 > resume 0x08000000

Replace the "jtagkey-tiny.cfg" with whatever JTAG device you are using, and/or
replace "olimex_stm32_h103.cfg" with your respective board config file.
