EFM32-TG-STK3300 Examples
=========================

Examples in this directory are designed to be run on the Energy Micro EFM32
Tiny Gecko Starter Kit, which is based on the EFM32TG840F32 MCU, has an onboard
USB debug and power management interface, and a bunch of peripherials built in
that demonstrate the chip's low power capabilities (LED, LCD display, light
sensor, touch slider, LC sensor, push buttons).
