# FIXME: i'd much rather have this in a heredoc, but heredocs are not that easy
# in makefiles. furthermore, this isn't caught by the clean target. actually,
# i'd very much prefer using openocd anyway, this would also get rid of the
# Default.ini and JLink.log files jlink.sh drops.

# just the next hack: jlink, as shipped in energy micro's
# energyAwareToolsBeta_30082011.tgz, needs its LD_LIBRARY_PATH explicitly set.
# it provides a wrapper script, but that fails to pass on arguments. set this
# path to the energymicro folder extracted from the tools, and we'll take care
# of the test
