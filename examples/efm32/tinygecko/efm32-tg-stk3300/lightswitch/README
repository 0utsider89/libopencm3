EFM32-TG-STK3300 Examples lightswitch README
============================================

This is a small example program for GPIO input and output, and how the device
can be configured to use minimal power (although the example is merely
scratching the surface of what is possible powersaving-wise).

It's intended for the EFM32-TG-STK3300 eval board. It turn the User LED on when
PB0 is pressed, and off when PB1 is pressed.

Various implementations are offered (-busywait, -interrupt), and can configured
in lightswitch.c.
