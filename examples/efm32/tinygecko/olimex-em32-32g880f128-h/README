EM-32G880F128-H Examples
========================

Examples in this directory are designed to be run on the OlimexEM-32G880F128-H
header breakout board, which is based on the EFM32G880F128 MCU.

The board is equipped with two user LEDs, a user button, reset button, power
supply, 20 pin debug connector and 10 pin UEXT connector (Olimex' open
versatile microcontroller connector).

The build system is designed to upload programs using the EFM32-TG-STK3300
board's external Segger debugger, which has to be configured for external
operation beforehand.
